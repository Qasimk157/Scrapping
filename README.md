# Scrapping
In file scrap_links_paragraphs.py we can scrap full data of a page, all the links only, paragraphs only or something like title etc alone by this file.
now we have a lots of links suppose two thousand or more from where we want to scrap data then we will use scarp_data.py file to scrap data and it gives the file name automatically
